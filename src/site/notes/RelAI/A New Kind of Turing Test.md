The main insight is very simple yet universal. 
P1: "Descriptions (Is Propositions) and Prescriptions (Ought Propositions) are the only kind of propositions"
therefore:
"Any System that reliably creates and understands descriptive and prescriptive propositions should be called generally intelligent."

So, I smuggled in 3 extra categories that should be further specified
1) reliable (some kind of a measure)
2) create (well, easy!)
3) understand (synonym for "already represent")

So let's clarify what P1 is in an ELI5 way, while noting that it can't be proved but only be observed.

Q - What is an "Is"?
"Is" Statements are Statements of factual Nature. 
e.g 
1) I **am** there.
2) He **is** *not* an avid Reader. 
3) The Sun **shines** in the blue Sky.

Q - The Set of "Is Statements"?
Clear from the Name.

---
Note_1 : There is no "is" as a verb in 3) but it still happens to be a factual Statement. Therefore the inclusion is justified as per the Definition. 

---
Q - What is an "Ought"?
"Ought" Statements are Statements of moral Nature. 
e.g. 
1) One **ought** *not* beat a Child. 
2) One **ought** to help the Poor. 

Q - The Set of "Ought Statements"?
Clear from the Name.

---
Note_2 : Obviously it makes, in total,  4 Categories. Namely : 
1) is 
2) is not
3) ought
4) ought not
But putting 1), 2) and 3), 4) seems just logical from the Definition above. 

----
What is already known about Is and Ought? 
1) They are of distinct nature 
2) One can't derive an ought from a set of Is Statements.  (Hume's Guillotine)

What is yet undiscovered? 
The fact these are the *only* two kinds of proposition, which gives a *sufficient* condition

What are the implications? 
1) Instead of the original turing test, which relies on fooling the interlocutor, this test is of real scientific and ethical significance, covers everything from "iPad *is* Black" to "Gravity *is* the curvature of spacetime" and more, from "One ought to love one's neighbour" to golden rule and more. 
2) Perhaps CogSci can take this as their highest goal, how do we move into descriptive and prescriptive space given a pre-programmed set of descriptions and prescriptions, I am aware that this is kind of an innatist persepctive. 


Note: I have very little knowledge 


### Extra stuff if you wanna get more context

Q - What is Hume's Guillotine?
"One can not derive an 'Ought' Statement from an 'Is' Statement."

Q - Is it particularly relevant here what Hume really believed with this throwaway Distinction? 
Not Really. 

Q - Then why all Tis'?
My Insight, that come to me when I was taking a Shower, was the following. 

"Instead of thinking (or even not thinking) about in what Way the two Sets (Is and Ought) are distinct (in that a collection of One would never be able to derive the Other), 

We should be thinking about what you can do when you take the Union of both."

Q - How about a more concise Version?
**The Insight_V1** : "Every interesting Statement is either moral or factual in Nature."
**The Insight_V2** : "(The Sets of) Is and Ought Statements together are collectively Exhaustive (wrt the Universal Set of all interesting Statements.)"

Q - Is there something New?
Yes and No. But mainly Yes. 
This Insight is advocated by many People in implicit Form but I have never come across this in a clear and explicit Manner. 

In implicit Form : 
1) Quote from Russell : Love and Pity for Suffering ("Oughts"), Knowledge ("Is")

2) Quote from Einstein : Observe the sublte Similarity of "Truth" (Is) and "Justice" (Ought)

3) Quote from Malcolm X : same as Einstein (a good Analogy is Curiosity (Is) and Ethics (Ought))

Q - Implications?
I have therefore come to the Conclusion that "living a Life consists of finding out moral and factual Truths and acting accordingly."

Q - Are the two Sets somehow related?
Yes, they seem to be related in the following Way. 

More Factual Truths make for a better ethical System. 
(e.g. knowing that Child-Beating **is** traumatic gets a long way in deciding whether or not smack your Child.)

Ethics limit the sort of Curiosity one can fulfill. 
(e.g Oppenheimer **ought** to have stopped the Manhattan Project.)

Q - How does that relate to Well-Being?
I would propose that instead of checking the Effects of singular "Is Statement"  the outcome, one ought to check Systems (better Term : Clusters) of "Is" and "Ought" Statements with a predefined Outcomes (which will be  an "Ought Statement"). This will also help in analysing what People believe (e.g Conservative Cluster vs Liberal Cluster).

Q - Is that it?
For now, Yes! I have to think more about this, even try to disprove it like an honest Person but till then I have figured out why I should walk the Road of Truth and Justice. Adios!
