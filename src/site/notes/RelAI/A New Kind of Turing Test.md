Q - What is an "Is"?
"Is" Statements are Statements of factual Nature. 
e.g 
1) I **am** there.
2) He **is** *not* an avid Reader. 
3) The Sun **shines** in the blue Sky.

Q - The Set of "Is Statements"?
Clear from the Name.

---
Note_1 : There is no "is" as a verb in 3) but it still happens to be a factual Statement. Therefore the inclusion is justified as per the Definition. 

---
Q - What is an "Ought"?
"Ought" Statements are Statements of moral Nature. 
e.g. 
1) One **ought** *not* beat a Child. 
2) One **ought** to help the Poor. 

Q - The Set of "Ought Statements"?
Clear from the Name.

---
Note_2 : Obviously it makes, in total,  4 Categories. Namely : 
1) is 
2) is not
3) ought
4) ought not
But putting 1), 2) and 3), 4) seems just logical from the Definition above.

Q - What is Hume's Guillotine?
"One can not derive an 'Ought' Statement from an 'Is' Statement."

Q - Is it particularly relevant here what Hume really believed with this throwaway Distinction? 
Not Really. 

Q - Then why all Tis'?
My Insight, that come to me when I was taking a Shower, was the following. 

"Instead of thinking (or even not thinking) about in what Way the two Sets (Is and Ought) are distinct (in that a collection of One would never be able to derive the Other), 

We should be thinking about what you can do when you take the Union of both."

Q - How about a more concise Version?
**The Insight_V1** : "Every interesting Statement is either moral or factual in Nature."
**The Insight_V2** : "(The Sets of) Is and Ought Statements together are collectively Exhaustive (wrt the Universal Set of all interesting Statements.)"

Q - Is there something New?
Yes and No. But mainly Yes. 
This Insight is advocated by many People in implicit Form but I have never come across this in a clear and explicit Manner. 

In implicit Form : 
1) Quote from Russell : Love and Pity for Suffering ("Oughts"), Knowledge ("Is")

2) Quote from Einstein : Observe the sublte Similarity of "Truth" (Is) and "Justice" (Ought)

3) Quote from Malcolm X : same as Einstein (a good Analogy is Curiosity (Is) and Ethics (Ought))

Q - Implications?
I have therefore come to the Conclusion that "living a Life consists of finding out moral and factual Truths and acting accordingly."

Q - Are the two Sets somehow related?
Yes, they seem to be related in the following Way. 

More Factual Truths make for a better ethical System. 
(e.g. knowing that Child-Beating **is** traumatic gets a long way in deciding whether or not smack your Child.)

Ethics limit the sort of Curiosity one can fulfill. 
(e.g Oppenheimer **ought** to have stopped the Manhattan Project.)

Q - How does that relate to Well-Being?
I would propose that instead of checking the Effects of singular "Is Statement"  the outcome, one ought to check Systems (better Term : Clusters) of "Is" and "Ought" Statements with a predefined Outcomes (which will be  an "Ought Statement"). This will also help in analysing what People believe (e.g Conservative Cluster vs Liberal Cluster).

Q - Is that it?
For now, Yes! I have to think more about this, even try to disprove it like an honest Person but till then I have figured out why I should walk the Road of Truth and Justice. Adios!
