**ai**: Here's a summary of the note on Organisms and Cell Composition:

1. Organizational Hierarchy:
   - Organs → Tissues → Cells → Organelles
   - Groups of tissues → Homogenous groups of cells → Cells → Distinct cell components

2. Cell Composition:
   - Atomic: H (60%), O (20%), C (12%), N (5%)
   - Molecular: Water (80%), Proteins (10%), Nucleic Acids (3%), Carbs (3%), Lipids (2%)

3. Chemical Bonds:
   - Covalent bonds are strong (83 kcal/mole for C-C)
   - Single bonds can rotate, double/triple bonds cannot
   - Enzymes act as bio-catalysts for specific bonds

4. Major Biomolecules:

   a) Lipids (5% dry mass):
   - Functions: membranes, energy storage, signaling, insulation
   - Types: phospholipids, triglycerides, steroids (including cholesterol)
   - Different fat types: cis (low MP), trans (high MP), saturated (high MP)

   b) Carbohydrates (25% dry mass):
   - Functions: energy source, carbon source, information carriers
   - Formula: (CH2O)n
   - Hydrophilic nature
   - Connected by glycosidic bonds

   c) Nucleic Acids:
   - Based on nucleotides
   - Forms phosphodiester bonds
   - DNA is double-stranded with base pairing (A:T, G:C)
   - Held together by hydrogen bonds

5. Macromolecules:
   - Form through condensation (releasing H2O)
   - Break down through hydrolysis
   - Both processes typically require energy
