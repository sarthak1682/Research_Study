**Improve Equivariance Support**
- **Length:** Medium (175 hours)
- **Description:** DeepChem has limited support for equivariant models. This project would extend support for equivariance to DeepChem and add additional equivariant model such as tensor field networks to DeepChem
- **Educational Value:** Equivariance is one of the most interesting ideas in modern machine learning and underpins powerful systems like AlphaFold2. Contributors will learn more about this field and could potentially write a research paper about their work on this project.
- **Potential Mentors:** Aryan, Riya, Nimisha, Bharath, Shreyas
