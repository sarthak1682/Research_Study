- Please be concise! Your proposal should not be more than 15 pages barring exceptional circumstances.
- Please be professional. Avoid excessive colloquialisms ("you", "I", blog-post like digressions). Keep the proposal focused on the technical work.
- Keep your introductions about yourselves brief and professional.
- Don't use font-sizes below 11 or above 12.
- No need to give long introductions about DeepChem or basic computer science concepts. You can trust the mentors already know these things
- Don't use excessive spacing. 1.15 spacing is probably right. 1.5 or 2 spacing is too much
- For PRs please note status of PRs (merged/under review/not reviewed)
- Please avoid excessive use of bold/italics. Keep the report looking professional.
