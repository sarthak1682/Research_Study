Prions are abnormal proteins that can cause severe neurodegenerative diseases in both humans and animals. They are unique and particularly dangerous pathogens because they:

1. Are misfolded versions of normal proteins found in the brain
2. Can convert normal proteins into more prions through a chain reaction
3. Are extremely resistant to standard sterilization methods like heat, radiation, and chemicals

Some notable prion diseases include:

- In humans:
    - Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
    - Fatal Familial Insomnia
    - Kuru (historically found in Papua New Guinea)
- In animals:
    - Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease") in cattle
    - Chronic Wasting Disease in deer and elk
    - Scrapie in sheep
