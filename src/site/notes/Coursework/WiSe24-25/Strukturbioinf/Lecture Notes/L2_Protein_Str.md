**Protein Structure and Function are Linked**
 The process of a linear amino acid chain folding into a complex 3D structure is known as protein folding. This folding process is dictated by the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their interactions with each other and the surrounding environment.

### **Levels of Protein Structure:**

We describe protein structure in terms of four hierarchical levels:

1. **Primary structure:** This is simply the linear sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.  It's like the letters of a word – the order matters!

2. **Secondary structure:** This refers to local structural elements **stabilized primarily by hydrogen bonds between the atoms of the peptide backbone** (not the side chains). The most **common secondary structures are alpha-helices and beta-sheets.**  An alpha-helix is a coiled structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds within the chain, while a beta-sheet consists of extended strands held together by hydrogen bonds between adjacent strands.  Turns and loops connect these secondary structure elements.  The beta-hairpin is a common example of a loop connecting two antiparallel beta-strands.  Beta-turns are tight turns that often connect strands in beta-sheets.
	1. alpha-helix: **Buried, Partially Buried, and Completely Exposed Helix**
		An alpha helix within a protein can have different levels of exposure to the surrounding solvent (usually water). This exposure depends on its location within the protein's 3D structure:
		
		* **Buried Helix:** Located in the protein's core, surrounded by other amino acid residues.  These helices are typically hydrophobic, contributing to the stability of the protein's folded state.![Screenshot 2025-01-07 at 04.21.39.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-01-07%20at%2004.21.39.png)
		* **Partially Buried Helix:**  Partly exposed to the solvent and partly interacting with other parts of the protein. These helices often have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues.
		* **Completely Exposed Helix:** Located on the protein's surface, fully exposed to the solvent. These helices are usually rich in hydrophilic residues and can participate in interactions with other molecules.

**Type I and Type II Tight Turns for Beta**
	Beta turns are tight, 180-degree turns involving four amino acid residues that often connect adjacent beta-strands in a beta-sheet. Type I and Type II are the most common types, differing in the conformation of the peptide bond between the second and third residues
	* **Type I:** The second residue typically has a proline, as its ring structure facilitates the tight turn.
	* **Type II:** The third residue is often glycine, as its small side chain minimizes steric hindrance and allows for the sharp turn.

Id: 1. By the possession of an intra-main-chain [hydrogen bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond "Hydrogen bond") between the [CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxyl_Group "Carboxyl Group") of residue _i_ and the [NH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_group "Amino group") of residue _i+3_;

A **Ramachandran plot** visualizes the dihedral angles (phi and psi) of the protein backbone. These angles describe the rotation around the N-Cα and Cα-C bonds, respectively, for each amino acid residue.  The plot helps determine the energetically favorable conformations of the protein backbone and identify secondary structure elements:

* **Alpha-helix:** In Ramachandran plots, alpha-helices fall within a distinct region characterized by phi values around -60 degrees and psi values around -45 degrees. This reflects the tightly coiled structure of the helix.
* **Beta-sheet:** Beta-sheets occupy a different region in the plot, with phi values around -120 degrees and psi values around +135 degrees.  This corresponds to the extended conformation of the beta-strands.

The Ramachandran diagram doesn't show *all* sterically possible angles.  It shows the *sterically *reasonable* values*

**Disulfide Bond Formation**

Disulfide bonds are covalent bonds formed between the sulfur atoms of **two cysteine residues.**  
Disulfide bonds can stabilize protein structure by cross-linking different parts of the polypeptide chain or between different subunits.

4. **Tertiary structure:** This is the overall three-dimensional arrangement of the polypeptide chain, including its secondary structure elements and the spatial relationships between them.  It's the complete folded protein.  Various forces stabilize tertiary structure: **hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds between side chains, ionic bonds (salt bridges), and disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues**.

5. **Quaternary structure:** Some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains, or subunits. Quaternary structure describes the arrangement of these subunits in the functional protein complex.

### **Amino Acids: The Building Blocks**

There are 20 standard amino acids, each with unique properties. We can categorize them based on their side chain characteristics: #remember

* **Aliphatic:** Hydrophobic, non-polar amino acids like alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine.
* **Aromatic:**  Also hydrophobic, containing aromatic rings. Includes phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.
* **Charged:**  These amino acids have either positive (basic: lysine, arginine, histidine) or negative (acidic: aspartate, glutamate) charges under physiological conditions.
* **Polar:**  These amino acids have uncharged but polar side chains, allowing them to form hydrogen bonds.  Examples include serine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, glutamine, and methionine.
* **Odd Couple:** Glycine and proline. Glycine has the smallest side chain (just a hydrogen) and provides flexibility. Proline has a unique cyclic structure that introduces rigidity and often disrupts regular secondary structure elements. #remember

**Chirality**

A crucial aspect of amino acids is their chirality.  **Most amino acids exist in two mirror image forms (L and D)**.  In proteins, **only the L-form is found**.  This "handedness" also extends to higher levels of structure, with right-handed beta-alpha-beta motifs and predominantly right-handed beta-beta units.

Mnemonic to remember L-form: CORN clockwise

Convention: The alpha carbon (Cα) in an amino acid is the central carbon atom bonded to the amino group (NH2), the carboxyl group (COOH), a hydrogen atom (H), and the variable side chain (R group).  It's called "alpha" because it's the first carbon atom attached to the functional group (carboxyl group) that defines the amino acid. 


**Structural Motifs and Domains**

Proteins often contain recurring structural patterns called motifs. These are small, specific combinations of secondary structure elements. Examples include beta-alpha-beta, helix-turn-helix, and the Greek key motif.  Domains are larger, independently folding units within a protein, often associated with specific functions.

**Protein Folds**

Folds describe the overall topological arrangement of secondary structure elements within a protein.  The TIM barrel is a classic example. These folds can be found in many different proteins, even those with unrelated sequences, highlighting the importance of physical and chemical principles in shaping protein structure.

**Membrane Proteins**

Membrane proteins reside within biological membranes.  Their structure is influenced by the hydrophobic environment of the membrane.  Transmembrane proteins span the membrane, typically with alpha-helices or beta-barrels.  The distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids in these proteins determines their orientation within the membrane.

**Structural Proteins**

Structural proteins like collagen and elastin provide mechanical support.  Collagen forms a triple helix, while elastin has a disordered structure that allows for elasticity.
