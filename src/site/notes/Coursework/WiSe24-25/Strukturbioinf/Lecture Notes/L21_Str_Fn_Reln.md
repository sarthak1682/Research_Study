**Slide 2: "What is a function of a protein?"**

*   **Content:** It then provides three different perspectives on defining protein function:
    *   **Biochemical Function:**  This defines function at the molecular level. It focuses on the chemical interactions a protein participates in. The example of an enzyme is used to illustrate this point, highlighting aspects like:
        *   The chemical reaction catalyzed.
        *   Substrates the enzyme binds.
        *   Ligands and cofactors required.
        *   Regulators that can affect the enzyme's action.
    *   **Biological Function:** This expands the definition to the cellular and physiological context. It considers the role of the protein *within* the cell, including:
        *   Localization to specific organelles or cell types.
        *   Involvement in biological pathways.
        *   Conditions (like heat shock) under which the protein becomes active.
    *   **Phenotypic Function:** This takes the broadest view, considering the protein's role in the *entire organism*.  It explains how to study this function by:
        *   Deleting or mutating the gene encoding the protein.
        *   Observing the resulting effects on the organism as a whole.

A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound that's required for certain enzymes to function properly. They can be:

- Inorganic ions (like zinc, iron, magnesium)
- Complex organic molecules (coenzymes) like vitamins B1, B2, B12

For example, the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase needs zinc as a cofactor to break down alcohol in your body.

**Slide 8: "Gene Ontology Functional Classification"**

*   **Content:** This slide explains the three main categories of the Gene Ontology:
    *   **Biological process:**
        *   Defines it as a biological objective a gene product contributes to.
        *   Describes it as a process involving chemical or physical transformations, accomplished by molecular functions.
        *   Explains that biological processes can be broad (e.g., cell growth) or specific (e.g., glycolysis).
    *   **Molecular function:**
        *   Defines it as the biochemical activity of a gene product, describing *what* it does.
        *   Emphasizes that it's independent of *where* or *when* the function occurs.
        *   Explains that molecular functions can be broad (e.g., enzyme) or specific (e.g., hexokinase).
    *   **Cellular component:**
        *   Defines it as the location in the cell where a gene product is active.
*   **Citation:** "Barlett et al., 2003" is cited.

Provides an enzyme example (muconolactone isomerase). Mentions 5 associated EC numbers.

**Slide 17: "Same fold, same function"**

    *   **Cartoon Diagrams:** Presents cartoon diagrams of two hemoglobins:
        *   **(a) V. stercoraria hemoglobin:** Hemoglobin from *V. stercoraria*.

    *   **"8% identity":** Indicates very low sequence identity (8%) between these two hemoglobins.
    *   **Key Message:**  Despite low sequence identity, these proteins share the same fold and the same function (oxygen transport, as hemoglobins). This highlights the importance of fold in determining function, sometimes even more than precise sequence.

**Slide 18: "Analogues"**

*   **Title:** "Analogues" -  Introduces the concept of analogous proteins.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Cartoon Diagrams:** Presents cartoon diagrams of two enzymes:
        *   **(a) Subtilisin EC 3.4.21.62:** A serine protease from bacteria.
        *   **(b) Chymotrypsin EC 3.4.21.1:** A serine protease from animals.
    *   **Key Points:**
        *   **No sequence identity:** These proteins have no significant sequence similarity.
        *   **Different folds:** They have different structural folds.
        *   **Identical three-dimensionally conserved Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad:** Despite differences in fold and sequence, they use the same catalytic mechanism: a Serine-Histidine-Aspartate triad. This triad is spatially arranged in a very similar way in both enzymes, even though the overall folds are different.
        *   **Example of convergent evolution:** This is a classic example of convergent evolution.  Different evolutionary paths have led to proteins with different structures but the same functional solution (catalyzing peptide bond hydrolysis using the Ser-His-Asp triad).

**Slide 22: "Three-dimensional structure of the putative factor-dependent ATPase from Methanococcus jannaschii"**
![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 00.14.03.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2000.14.03.png)


*   **Content:**
    *   **Key Findings:**
        *   **Nucleotide-binding pocket:** The MJ0577 monomer contains a nucleotide-binding pocket, similar to other ATP-binding proteins, and is shown to bind ATP.
        *   **Factor-dependent ATPase:**  Although the protein itself didn't show ATPase activity in isolation, the authors hypothesize it's a factor-dependent ATPase, meaning it needs other components to stimulate ATP hydrolysis.


**Slide 23: "Moonlighting proteins"**

*   **Definition:** Defines "moonlighting" as having multiple, sometimes unrelated, functions within a single polypeptide chain.
*   **Mechanisms:** Explains that there are several ways a gene can encode multiple functions, including alternative RNA splicing.


**Slide 24: "Examples" - Moonlighting Proteins**

*   **Cytosolic enzymes that moonlight as extracellular growth factors:**  Gives context by defining "growth factor" (signaling molecule between cells, affects cell differentiation and maturation).  This illustrates how an enzyme with a primary cytosolic function can also have a secondary role as a signaling molecule outside the cell.
*   **Monomeric or homo-oligomeric enzymes that have a second function as a subunit in the proteasome or another multimeric complex:**  Shows how an enzyme can also be a structural component of a larger complex, in addition to its enzymatic activity.
*   **Crystallins in the lens of the eye that are identical to ubiquitous soluble enzymes:** Crystallins, important for lens transparency, are often found to be the same proteins as common metabolic enzymes. This highlights a very different, structural "moonlighting" role.
