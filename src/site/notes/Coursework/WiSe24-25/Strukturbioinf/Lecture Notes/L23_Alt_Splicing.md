**Slide 2: Typical eukaryotic gene**
 the progression from genomic DNA to spliced mRNA.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Genomic DNA:** Shows exons (coding regions) and introns (non-coding regions) within the gene.  The promoter region (where transcription starts) is also indicated.
    *   **Transcription:** The process of creating pre-mRNA from the DNA template.
    *   **Pre-mRNA:** The initial RNA transcript, containing both introns and exons.
    *   **Splicing:** The crucial process where introns are removed, and exons are joined together.  This is highlighted with a red circle.
    *   **Spliced mRNA:** The mature messenger RNA, ready for translation into a protein.
    * **5' leader and 3' noncoding region:** the parts of the mRNA that aren't translated into protein.

**Slide 3: Sequences at the intron-exon boundary**

*   **Title:** Sequences at the intron-exon boundary
*   **Diagram:** Zooms in on the critical sequences at the boundaries between introns and exons.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **5' splice site:**  The sequence at the beginning of the intron (donor site).  The consensus sequence `...AGGUAAGU...` is shown. The "GU" is highly conserved.
    *   **Branch site:** An "A" nucleotide within the intron, crucial for the splicing reaction.
    *   **3' splice site:** The sequence at the end of the intron (acceptor site). The consensus sequence `...[Py tract] AGG...` is shown.  The "AG" is highly conserved.  "[Py tract]" represents a polypyrimidine tract (a region rich in C and U nucleotides).

**Slide 4: Summary of Major Consensus Sequences for mRNA Splicing**

*   **Diagrams:** Two diagrams, one simplified, one more detailed.
    * The top diagram is a simple visualization.
    * The bottom diagram presents the frequencies with which nucleotides occur.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Consensus Sequences:**  Highlights the key nucleotide sequences involved in splicing.
    *   **5' Splice Site:** Emphasizes the highly conserved "GU" dinucleotide.
    *   **Branch Point:** Emphasizes the conserved "A" nucleotide.
    *   **3' Splice Site:** Emphasizes the highly conserved "AG" dinucleotide.
    *   **R, Y, N:**  Standard abbreviations: R = purine (A or G), Y = pyrimidine (C or U), N = any nucleotide.
    *   **Frequency of occurrence:**  The bottom diagram shows the percentage of times each nucleotide appears at each position in the consensus sequences.  This illustrates the strong conservation of the GU at the 5' splice site, the A at the branch point, and the AG at the 3' splice site.

**Slide 5: Splicing of pre-mRNA**

*   **Diagram:** Illustrates the two-step chemical reaction of splicing.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Step 1 (Lariat Formation):**
        *   The 2'-OH group of the branch point "A" attacks the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site (the G of the GU).
        *   This forms a lariat-like intermediate (a loop structure).  This is the "Lasso!" highlighted.
    *   **Step 2 (Exon Ligation):**
        *   The 3'-OH group of the upstream exon (now free) attacks the phosphodiester bond at the 3' splice site.
        *   This joins the two exons together and releases the intron as a lariat.

**Slide 6: Spliceosome**

*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Composition:** Composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and over 150 proteins.
    *   **Function:** Performs pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells.
    *   **Size:**  Large (50-60S), indicating a significant macromolecular complex.
    



**Slide 10: The splicing machine**

*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **SR (Splicing Regulatory) Proteins:**  Proteins that bind to specific sequences in the pre-mRNA and regulate splicing.
    *   **ESE (Exonic Splicing Enhancer):**  Sequences within exons that promote exon inclusion.  SR proteins bind to ESEs.
    *   **ESS (Exonic Splicing Suppressor):** Sequences within exons that promote exon skipping.  Some SR proteins (or other factors) can bind to ESSs.
    *   **Spliceosome Formation:** Shows how SR proteins recruit U1 and U2 snRNPs to the correct splice sites.
    *   **Splicing Suppression:**  Explains how SR proteins can also *prevent* splicing at certain sites, leading to exon skipping.

**Slide 11: Negative and positive control of alternative RNA splicing**

*   **Title:** Negative and positive control of alternative RNA splicing
*   **Diagram:**  Illustrates how splicing can be regulated in different tissues.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **(A) Negative Control:** A *repressor* protein binds to the pre-mRNA in one tissue, preventing the spliceosome from removing an intron.  This leads to a different mRNA (and potentially protein) in that tissue.
    *   **(B) Positive Control:** An *activator* protein is required for the spliceosome to efficiently remove an intron.  Without the activator, the intron is not removed.

**Slide 12: A single splicing pathway**
![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.37.36.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.37.36.png)

**Slide 13: Alternative splicing**

![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.37.30.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.37.30.png)


**Slide 15: Sex-specific alternative splicing of sxl pre-mRNA**
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   ***sxl* (Sex-lethal):**  A gene involved in sex determination in flies.
    *   **Males:**  In males, exon 3 is included, which contains a stop codon.  This results in a non-functional SXL protein.
    *   **Females:**  In females, exon 3 is skipped. This produces a functional SXL protein, which then regulates the splicing of other genes involved in female development.
    ![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.38.27.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.38.27.png)

**Slide 16: Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA that encodes a transcription factor**

*   **Diagram:**  Another example of how alternative splicing can have significant functional consequences.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Transcription Factor:** A protein that regulates gene expression.
    *   **Two Isoforms:**  The pre-mRNA can be spliced to produce:
        *   **Activator:**  Includes all four exons, resulting in a protein with both a DNA-binding domain and an activation domain.
        *   **Repressor:**  Skips exon 3, resulting in a protein that *lacks* the activation domain.  This protein can still bind DNA but cannot activate transcription; it acts as a repressor.![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.39.44.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.39.44.png)

**Slide 17: Alternative splicing is common in many eukaryotes**

*   **Title:** Alternative splicing is common in many eukaryotes
*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Early Views:**  The initial assumption was one gene, one protein (one splicing pathway).
    *   **Now:** Alternative splicing is widespread, allowing a single gene to produce multiple mRNAs and proteins.
    *   **Prevalence:**  Common in higher eukaryotes, less common in some simpler organisms (like yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_).
    *   **Drosophila Example:** The number of proteins in the *Drosophila* proteome is much larger than the number of genes, suggesting extensive alternative splicing.
    *   **Human Genome:**  The human genome has far fewer genes than initially predicted, with alternative splicing explaining much of the protein diversity. (ot 80 000â€“100 000 genes, as suggested by the size of the human proteome, but rather only 25000-35 000 genes)
    *   **"One gene, one protein" Dogma:**  This principle has been overturned by the discovery of alternative splicing.



**Slide 20: Great Diversity Exists**

![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.41.46.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.41.46.png)

**Slide 21: Alternative Splicing May Not Be the Key to Proteome Complexity**

*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Challenge to the Dogma:** While alternative splicing is common at the *transcript* level (detected by RNA-seq), proteomics studies (using mass spectrometry) find far fewer alternative protein isoforms.
    *   **Main Isoform:** Most human genes appear to have one main protein isoform.
    *   **Conserved Isoforms:** The alternative isoforms that *are* detected tend to be:
        *   Evolutionarily conserved.
        *   Functionally relevant (don't disrupt important protein domains).
    *   **Non-functional Transcripts:**  Many predicted alternative transcripts may not be translated into proteins or may be degraded.  They might be "noise."

**Slide 22: Impact of Alternative Splicing on the Human Proteome**

*   **Title:** Impact of Alternative Splicing on the Human Proteome
*   **Diagram:**  Illustrates an experimental approach to study the relationship between alternative splicing (at the RNA level) and protein abundance.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **RNA-sequencing:**  Used to assess changes in transcript levels (transcriptomics).
    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** Used to assess changes in protein levels (proteomics).
    *   **Integration:**  Combining RNA-seq and mass spectrometry data to see if changes in transcript levels correlate with changes in protein levels.
    *   **Conclusion:** Alterations in transcript usage and gene expression *do* alter protein abundance, but the relationship is often complex.  Not every change in RNA splicing leads to a detectable change in protein levels.

**Slide 23: Types of Alternate Splicing**

*   **Title:** Types of Alternate Splicing
*   **Diagram:**  Illustrates the common patterns of alternative splicing.
*   **Key Types:**
    *   **(a) Retained Intron:** An intron is sometimes *not* removed, leading to a different mRNA.
    *   **(b) Competing 5' splice sites:**  Different 5' splice sites can be used, leading to exons of different lengths.
    *   **(c) Competing 3' splice sites:** Different 3' splice sites can be used.
    *   **(d) Multiple promoters:**  Different start sites for transcription can lead to different 5' ends of the mRNA.
    *   **(e) Multiple poly(A) sites:**  Different sites for adding the poly(A) tail can lead to different 3' ends.
    *   **(f) Cassette exons (Exon Skipping):**  An entire exon can be included or excluded.  This is a very common type of alternative splicing.
    *   **(g) Mutually exclusive exons:**  One of two (or more) exons is included, but never both.
![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.44.09.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.44.09.png)



**Slide 24: The multiple exons of the Drosophila DSCAM gene**

*   **Key Elements:**
    *   ***DSCAM*:**  A gene involved in neuronal development (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule).
    *   **Multiple Exons:**  The gene has many exons, with several sets of *mutually exclusive* exons.
    *   **Combinatorial Diversity:**  The different combinations of exons can generate a *huge* number of different mRNA and protein isoforms (12 x 48 x 33 x 2 = 38,016!).  This diversity is thou![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.45.15.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.45.15.png)ght to be important for neuronal wiring.

**Slide 25: How does alternative splicing occur?**

*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Not All Splice Sites Used:**  Some splice sites are only used some of the time.
    *   **Types of AS:**
        *   **Constitutive:** More than one product is *always* made.
        *   **Regulated:** Different isoforms are produced at different times, in different tissues, or under different conditions.

**Slide 26: Constitutive alternative splicing of the SV40 T antigen RNA**

*   **Diagram:**  An example of constitutive alternative splicing.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **SV40 T antigen:**  A viral protein.
    *   **Two Isoforms:**  Two different mRNAs (and proteins) are produced from the same pre-mRNA:
        *   **Large T antigen:**  Uses the 5'SST splice site.
        *   **Small t antigen:** Uses the 5'sst splice site.
    *   **Both Forms Produced:** Both isoforms are typically produced.

**Slide 28: Known Roles of Alternative Splicing - Add new protein parts**

*   **Key Point:** 75% of the instances of alternative splicing change the protein coding region.

**Slide 29: Known Roles of Alternative Splicing - Consequences of new protein parts**

*   **Key Points:**  Alternative splicing can alter:
    *   **Protein binding properties:**  Affecting interactions with other molecules.
    *   **Intracellular localization:**  Changing where the protein is located within the cell.
    *   **Extracellular localization:**  Affecting secretion or membrane insertion.
    *   **Enzymatic or signaling activities:**  Modifying the protein's function.
    *   **Protein stability:**  Affecting how long the protein lasts.
    *   **Post-translational modification domains:**  Changing how the protein is modified after translation.
    *   **Change Ion channel properties:** For ion channel proteins.

**Slide 30: Known Roles of Alternative Splicing - Influence RNA
![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.51.00.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.51.00.png)


*   **Key Point:**  Alternative splicing can also affect the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA, which can influence:
    *   **Subcellular localization:**  Where the mRNA is located within the cell.
    *   **RNA stability:**  How long the mRNA lasts before being degraded.
    *   **Translation efficiency:** Whether the mRNA is translated to a protein.

**Slide 31: Known Roles of Alternative Splicing - Coordinated Regulation of Biological Events**

*   **Key Points:**  Alternative splicing plays a role in coordinating many important biological processes, including:
    *   Neuron development
    *   Channel activity associated with hearing
    *   Muscle contraction
    *   Neurite growth
    *   Cell differentiation
    *   Apoptosis (programmed cell death)

**Slide 32: Computational identification of alternative splicing**
![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 01.52.06.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2001.52.06.png)

*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **mRNA:**  Full-length messenger RNA sequences.
    *   **ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags):**  Partial mRNA sequences, often shorter and less accurate than full-length mRNAs.
    *   **Alignment:**  ESTs are aligned to mRNA sequences (or to the genome).
    *   **Detection of Differences:**  Insertions or deletions in ESTs relative to the mRNA suggest alternative splicing events.

**Slide 33: Splices are identified and intronic splice junction donor and acceptor sites are checked**


*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Alignment to Genomic DNA:**  ESTs and mRNAs are aligned to the genomic DNA sequence.
    *   **Splice Junctions:**  The boundaries between exons and introns are identified.
    *   **Consensus Sequences:**  The splice junction sequences (GT-AG) are checked to confirm that they are likely to be *bona fide* splice sites.
    *   **Mutually Exclusive Splices:**  Alternative splicing is detected when two different splice patterns are observed for the same region of the gene.



**Slide 35: Experimental analysis of alternative splicing**

*   **Diagrams:**  Illustrates two common experimental methods for studying alternative splicing: RT-PCR and microarrays.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction):**
        *   Primers are designed to flank the alternatively spliced region.
        *   Different sized PCR products indicate different splice isoforms.
        *   The relative abundance of different isoforms can be assessed by analyzing the PCR products on a gel.
    *   **Microarrays:**
        *   Probes are designed to target specific exon-exon junctions.
        *   Different splice isoforms will hybridize to different probes.
        *   Microarrays allow for high-throughput analysis of alternative splicing across many genes and tissues.

**Slide 37: Summary of some large scale alternative splicing papers**

*   **Key Point:**  Different studies, using different datasets and methods, produced varying estimates of the percentage of human genes that undergo alternative splicing (ranging from 22% to 59%). 


**Slide 40: Levels of alternative splicing in 16 human tissues with moderate or high EST sequence coverage**

*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Tissue-Specific Splicing:**  Different tissues have different levels of alternative splicing.
    *   **Types of AS:**  The graphs show the prevalence of:
        *   Skipped exons.
        *   Alternative 3' splice sites.
        *   Alternative 5' splice sites.
    * Brain, Liver and Testis have high levels of alternative splicing.

**Slide 41: A measure of dissimilarity between mRNA isoforms**

* ![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 02.02.29.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2002.02.29.png)





**Slide 44: Increase of functional diversity by alternative splicing**

* **Goals:** To measure the impact of alternative splicing on proteins
*   **Key Points/Approach:** This is a study's setup.
    *   **Quantify Effects on Domains:**  Determine how often alternative splicing affects known protein domains.
    *   **Map to Functional/Structural Units:**  See where alternatively spliced regions are located relative to known protein structures and functional sites.
    *   **Data:**  Analyzed alternatively spliced protein isoforms from several organisms.

**Slide 45: The distribution of alternatively spliced regions in human...**

*   **Bar Graphs:**  Shows the distribution of alternatively spliced regions relative to protein domains and functional sites.
*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Comparison to Random:**  The observed distribution is compared to what would be expected if alternative splicing occurred randomly.
    *   **Non-Random Distribution:**  Alternative splicing is *not* randomly distributed:
        *   It often affects *parts* of functional elements or domains (rather than entire domains).
        *   A significant proportion occurs in regions with *no* annotated function.
        * The observed alternative splicing is more likely to affect the functional aspects of the protein.

**Slide 46, 47: Structural location of alternatively spliced regions**

*   **Protein Structures:**  Shows 3D protein structures with alternatively spliced regions highlighted.
*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Example 1 (Deoxynypusine synthase):**  The alternatively spliced region is located in the protein core, near the ligand binding site.  The shorter isoform is inactive.
    *   **Example 2 (Serine hydroxymethyltransferase):**  The alternatively spliced region is located on the protein surface.

**Slide 48: Alternative splicing and protein structure evolution**

*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Mapping to Structures:**  Researchers mapped alternatively spliced regions onto known protein structures (from the PDB).
    *   **Effects on Structure:**
        *   About half of the alternative splicing events affect variable regions of the protein or entire domains.
        *   The other half affect structured, conserved regions, suggesting potentially significant functional consequences.

**Slide 49: Two possible explanations**
 two possible explanations for the non-trivial alternative splicing events (those that affect conserved protein regions):
    *   **Non-functional:**  The alternatively spliced transcripts might be non-functional and degraded (nonsense-mediated decay).
    *   **Functional (with altered properties):**  The alternatively spliced isoforms might have *new* or altered functions, even if they lack some conserved regions. The slide argues this is plausible.


**Slide 55: Evolutionary conservation of the alternative splicing**

*   **Orthologous Genes:**  Genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestor.
*   **Conservation of Splicing:**  Some alternative splicing events are conserved between human and mouse, suggesting functional importance.  Other events are *not* conserved, suggesting they may be species-specific or less functionally critical.

**Slide 56: Comparison of alternative splicing levels in human versus mouse for orthologous exons.**
*   **Key Point:**  Exon inclusion levels (the frequency with which an exon is included in the mRNA) are often *conserved* between human and mouse, suggesting that the regulation of alternative splicing is also conserved.

**Slide 57: Exon inclusion levels versus evolutionary conservation...**

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Constitutive and Major Exons:**  Almost always conserved between human and mouse.
    *   **Minor Exons:**  Often *not* conserved, suggesting that they may have arisen more recently in evolution.

**Slide 58: Exon inclusion levels versus evolutionary conservation of orthologous exons in human and rat.**

*   **Title:** Exon inclusion levels versus evolutionary conservation of orthologous exons in human and rat.
*   **Table:**  Similar to the previous slide, but comparing human and rat.
*   **Key Point:**  The same pattern is observed: constitutive and major exons are highly conserved, while minor exons are less conserved.



**Slide 61: Alternative isoform regulation in human tissue transcriptomes**

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **High Prevalence of AS:**  92-94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing.
    *   **Tissue-Specific Splicing:**  Most alternative splicing events vary between tissues.
    *   **Coordinated Regulation:**  Alternative splicing and alternative cleavage/polyadenylation are often coordinated.

**Slide 62: Deep sequencing!**

* **Diagram:** The frequency of alternative splicing in human genes.
*   **Key Point:**  Deep sequencing (high-throughput RNA sequencing) allows for much more accurate quantification of alternative splicing events than earlier methods.
