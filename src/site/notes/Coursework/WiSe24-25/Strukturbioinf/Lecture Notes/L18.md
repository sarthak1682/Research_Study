**Slide 4: A strange one…**

This slide contrasts the “normal” sequence with a highly unusual one, labeled "A strange one...". This sequence, from *Dictyostelium discoideum*, is characterized by long stretches of Asparagine (N) and Glutamine (Q) residues. This is a clear example of a low-complexity sequence, as it deviates significantly from the average amino acid composition shown in the previous slide. Such repetitive sequences often indicate disordered regions.

**Slide 5: Segments of non-random amino acid composition**

This slide formally defines segments of non-random amino acid composition.  These segments are common in natural proteins and are characterized by overrepresentation of specific amino acids (Ala, Gly, Pro, Gln, Ser, Thr, Asn, Glu, Asp, Arg, His, Met, Lys, Ile, Leu, Val, Phe, or combinations thereof).  Three types are mentioned: homopolymers (repeats of a single amino acid), irregular mosaics (mixtures of two or more residues), and short-period regular repeats.

**Slide 6: Measurement of local compositional complexity**

This slide introduces the concept of "local compositional complexity," a measure that quantifies the randomness of a sequence segment within a defined window.  It’s independent of periodic or irregular repetitions.  The complexity is represented by a vector of numbers, where each number represents the count of a specific amino acid within the window.  Examples are given for least complex (homopolymer) and most complex (equal distribution of all amino acids) vectors.

**Slide 7: Local compositional complexity (formula)**

This slide provides the mathematical formula for calculating local compositional complexity (K). The formula uses factorials to calculate the number of possible arrangements of amino acids given the composition within the window.  A lower K value indicates lower complexity (more order/repetitiveness), while a higher K value indicates higher complexity (more disorder/randomness).

**Slide 8: Local compositional complexity (example)**

This slide provides concrete examples of how to calculate K.  It shows the calculation for GGGG (a homopolymer, K=0, least complex) and CTGA (perfectly mixed, K=0.573, most complex). This reinforces the idea that K quantifies the randomness of the sequence within a window.



**Slide 19: The LC diagram**

This diagram visually represents the relationship between sequence complexity composition (percentage of most frequent amino acids) and periodicity (mutations to perfect repeats). It positions different types of sequences (homorepeats, long perfect repeats, long imperfect repeats, high-complexity sequences, unbiased proteins) within this two-dimensional space, illustrating how these measures can be used to categorize protein sequences.

**Slide 20: Protein disorder**

This slide defines protein disorder as the lack of regular secondary structure and high flexibility. It contrasts disordered regions with ordered (globular) regions, which have well-defined 3D structures. It also emphasizes that disorder is indirectly observed through various experimental methods.

**Slide 21: Intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs)**

This slide introduces the concept of intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs), which lack a fixed 3D structure display a highly flexible, random-coil-like conformation under physiological conditions.  It challenges the traditional structure-function paradigm and emphasizes the functional importance of IUPs.

**Slide 22: Structure of intrinsically unstructured regions**
 They contact their targets over large surface areas, largely maintain their extended conformation upon binding, and have multiple contact points due to their flexibility.

**Slide 23: Functional implications of protein disorder**

This slide outlines the current understanding of the functional roles of protein disorder. Disordered regions allow for multiple interaction partners, modification sites, flexible regulation, and contribute to diseases related to misfolding and aggregation.

**Slide 24: Binding affinity and specificity**

This figure compares the binding affinity and specificity of rigid/ordered proteins and flexible/disordered proteins. Flexible proteins can adopt different conformations and wrap around their targets, leading to higher specificity but potentially lower affinity compared to a hypothetical rigid protein with the same bound conformation.

**Slide 25: Examples**

This slide provides visual examples of disordered regions in protein complexes, including Cdk2-cyclin A, Tcf3-β-catenin, and Bob1-TAFII105-Oct1.

**Slide 26: Amino acid frequencies of ordered and disordered proteins**

This table compares the amino acid frequencies in intrinsically unstructured proteins, Swiss-Prot proteins, and globular proteins.  It highlights the overrepresentation of certain amino acids (e.g., Glu, Lys, Pro) and underrepresentation of others (e.g., Cys, Trp) in disordered regions.

**Slide 27: Domain organization of intrinsically unstructured proteins**

This slide illustrates the domain organization of several intrinsically unstructured proteins, showing the distribution of disordered regions (colored segments) along the protein sequence. It also indicates the locations of specific binding partners and functional regions.

**Slide 28: Disorder is not the same as low complexity**

This slide clarifies the distinction between disorder and low complexity. While SEG can be used to predict disorder by identifying low-complexity regions, not all low-complexity regions are necessarily disordered.

**Slide 29: GlobProt: exploring protein sequences for globularity and disorder**

This slide introduces GlobProt, a tool for predicting globular and disordered regions based on a running sum of amino acid propensities for order or disorder.

**Slide 30: Disorder propensity**

This chart shows the propensity of different amino acids to be disordered according to two different scales (Russell/Linding and Deleage/Roux).  Proline shows a high propensity for disorder, while several hydrophobic amino acids show a low propensity.

**Slide 33: Disordered regions and SMART sequence domains**

This histogram shows the distribution of disordered segment lengths and their relationship with SMART sequence domains (overlapped, nested, outside).

**Slide 34: GlobPlot uses**

This slide lists various applications of GlobPlot, including identifying regions problematic for crystallization, finding putative domains/functional sites, searching for IUPs, visualizing propensity sets, and building IUP databases.

**Slide 35: DisEMBL**

This slide introduces DisEMBL, a computational tool for predicting disordered regions based on three different propensities (coils, hot loops, missing coordinates) and neural networks.

This slide shows a screenshot of the DisProt database, a resource for intrinsically disordered proteins.

**Slide 42: p53 example**

This slide shows a comprehensive overview of p53, including its interaction partners, domain organization, post-translational modifications, and disorder predictions.  It highlights the relationship between disorder and function in this important protein.
