Organs -> Tissues -> Cells -> Organelles

groups of tissues -> homogenous groups of cells -> cells -> Distinct components in a cell

Cell Composition (Atomic): 60, 20, 12,5: H,O,C,N
Cell Comp (Molecular): 80, 10, 3,3, 2 : H20, Proteins, Nucleic Acids, Carbs, Lipids

Covalent/H/Ionic/Van-der-Waals.. Bonds


Covalent Bonds: 
	Strong, sharing of e- 
	break a C-C bond: 83 kcal/mole
		they don't break on their own under normal physiological conditions
		they can rotate, bend
	Enzymes
		Bio Catalysts enabling "specific" bonds to be broken or formed under phys. conditions. 
	Double/Triple bonds can't rotate, whereas single bonds could

DNAs have H-Bonds


----
Macromolecules are often polymers 
	Condensation (Form Bonds M-O-M) Release H2O
	Hydrolysis 
		Both often require energy

Lipids (5% dry mass of a cell: ie without water)
	required for membranes (phospholipids)
	energy stores
	involved in signalling processes
	Insulation 
	
	Glycerol + Fatty Acid = Triglyceride (Condensation reaction/Trans-esterification) [[copilot-conversations/write_the_reaction_Glycerol_+_Fatty_Acid_=_Triglyceride_(Condensation@20241220_184952\|write_the_reaction_Glycerol_+_Fatty_Acid_=_Triglyceride_(Condensation@20241220_184952]]
	
	Cis-fats are packed poorly, low melting point
	Trans Uns. Fats: packed tightly, high MP. 
	Sat. Fats: high MP, bad for health
	
	Steroids: Lipids with common ring structure
		precursor: Cholesterol (LDL = Bad)
		+ Vit D, Testosterone, Cortisol


Carbs (25% dry mass)
	Energy Source
	Carbon Source
	Info (blood type)

	(CH20)N: Hydrophilic
	Monosaccharide is the monomer (Reaction: R1-C-O-C-R2 + H2O)
	COC : Glycocidic Bond


Nucleic Acids: 
	Nucleotide: 
		Making of a dinucleotide: 
		phospho-diester bond
		13:28
	Different Ends, Bases Have linear order
	DNA: double stranded usually via base pairing through hydrogen bonds (A: T/U), G: C (AT is a base pair e.g)

Peptide: <20 AA
Protein: >20 AA 

Delta (G) < 0, Energy Released, Exergonic, "Spontaneous" (not necessary, needs a push: "Activation Energy")
.. endergonic


Catalysts decrease AC and allow a reaction to proceed. 

Enzymes: Biological Catalysts (usually proteins, can be RNAs)

Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction (unlike Platinum, which is useful for basically any reaction involving Hydrogen)

the protein is generally quite large, the rest regulates the activity of the enzyme. 
	Inhibitors (Rev/Irrev): Competitive (Binds active site) vs Non-Comp (Binds Elsewhere)![Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 22.49.39.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202025-01-01%20at%2022.49.39.png)
		Allosteric Activators/Inhibitors: Bind specific allosteric Site. 
		pH/Temp can change Enzyme function
