Cellular Chem

Metabolism = Sum of all Chemical Reactions in the Cell
	Catabolic Reactions: Break Down Molecules
	Anabolic Reaction: Build Up

Reactions governed by "free energy" 
$\delta G = \delta H - T \delta S$ 
3 Possibilities for G

Even if $\delta G$ is -ve, sometimes the reaction will not proceed, it will need some activation energy as a form of a push. 
Catalysts bring Activation Energy Down (E.g. Enzymes, mostly Protein)
	Do not change $\delta G$ but change the rate of reaction. 


Pathways and Feedback Loops

Org of Cell

Cell is surrounded by plasma membrane (/cell membrane)
	amphipathic (both polar and non-polar char) lipids that form a bilayer ()
		largely hydrophobic
		channels/pores allow stuff through the membrane

Inside the cell: 
Organelles 
	sub-cellular structure with specific function
		Nucleus/Genes
		Cytoplasm
		Mitochonrion
		Chronoplast

protein Synthesis
	ER/Ribosomes/Golgi Apparatus 

Lysosome: Breaking down cellular components
Cytoskeleton/Cilia/Flagella: Movement/Shape/Structure


Cell Div
Two Parts: 
	DNA Replication
	DNA Partitioning
Genes are organized in Chr
	Body cells contain two of each chr (diploid)
		individual matchings are called homologs
	Germ cells contain one of each chr (Haploid)

2 Types of cell div;
	Mitosis
		In Body cells (2 daughter cells id to the parent cells )
			DNA Replicates
				Chrs line up on spindles
				Daughter cell gets one copy of each chr

Meiosis
	Production of Germ Cells
	4 cells (all haploid), not id to the parent
	Chrs pair and exchange DNA Segments
