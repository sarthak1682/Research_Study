# Inheritance and Genetics





## Genes to Proteins



DNA Changes occur in the Bases

types of Mutations:
	point M (Change 1 base)
		**-** a **missense mutation**, in which the changed nucleotide base results in a single amino acid change in the protein product.   
		**-** a **silent mutation**, in which the changed nucleotide base does not result in any changes to the amino acids in the protein product.   
		**-** a **nonsense mutation**, in which the codon that includes changed nucleotdie base changes from coding for an amino acid to a stop codon that terminates translation.
	Insertion
	Deletion
		Frameshift Mutations for both of the above
	
## Allele Segregation

Allele = Alt forms of Genes (relative to the wild type)
	due to DNA Seq diff (variation)

Mitosis 
	Daughter Alleles = parent Alleles

Meiosis (gives rise to Gametes (germ Cells))
	Alleles Segregate (Gamete Alleles Set != Parents)

### **Dominant v. Recessive**

When in combination, different traits can be either dominant or recessive. If a trait is **dominant**, it will be expressed whenever an allele for that trait is present. If a trait is **recessive**, it will be expressed ONLY when the allele for that trait is present AND dominant alleles are absent.

For example, for a gene determines color, there may be an allele (A) that codes for red color and an allele (a) that codes for green color.   
If A is dominant to a (meaning that a is recessive to A), then AA = red, Aa = red, and aa = green.

However, some traits have more complicated expression patterns. With the same example gene, **incomplete dominance** would result in a new, blended trait when different alleles are present.   
For example: Aa = orange. 

There is also **codominance** in which the traits of both alleles are expressed leading to a mixed trait.   
For example: Aa = red and green spots.

## Pedigrees


### **Pedigrees and Modes of Inheritance**

A **pedigree** is a visual diagram used to map out the inheritance of genetic traits within a family. Pedigrees are often useful for determining the mode of inheritance, or inheritance pattern, of a particular trait. 

Genetic traits can display various modes of inheritance. They can be either dominant or recessive, and they can be either autosomal or X-linked. This course focuses on the following modes of inheritance:

- **Autosomal recessive**: a recessive trait that is inherited on any chromosome that is not X or Y  
    Pedigrees of autosomal recessive traits exhibit affected offspring from TWO unaffected parents (both sexes should be affected equally). 
- **Autosomal dominant**: a dominant trait that is inherited on any chromosome that is not X or Y  
    For pedigrees of autosomal dominant traits, every affected offspring has one affected parent (both sexes should be affected equally). 
- **X-linked recessive**: a recessive trait that is inherited on the X chromosome (this means that females will each have two alleles and males will only have one)  
    Pedigress of X-linked recessive traits will often have only males affected.
