# Building with DNA

## Restriction Digests


Genetic Engg = Recombinant DNA Tech


### **Restriction Endonucleases**


A **restriction endonuclease**, sometimes referred to simply as a restriction enzyme, cuts double-stranded DNA at palindrome sequences. Each restriction endonuclease cuts at one specific sequence. After being cut, the double-stranded DNA is left with "sticky ends". Different restriction endonucleases leave different types of sticky ends, which are reviewed below.

## Compatible Ends


**Cloning** is the process of isolating a gene of interest (GOI) and expressing it in an organism.

A **vector** is any carrier of DNA that can deliver that DNA, i.e. the GOI, to the cell and be replicated. One common example of a vector is a **plasmid**, which is a piece of small, circular DNA.

Ligation refers to the process of joining two pieces of DNA or RNA together.
It's like gluing two ends of a rope to make it whole again.

In order for the GOI to integrate into the vector, the two need to be cut in a way that gives them compatible ends. In this way, they can match up and ligate into a new circular plasmid without any breaks.

## PCR

Exp Amplification: take a tiny amount of DNA, make much more. 


1. denaturation:  break it apart into two single strands
2. primer annealing (add (anneal) short pieces of DNA)
3. extension (synthesis of new DNA by the DNA polymerase, Taq Polymerase)
