Cell: 10 micrometer
made up of multiple (macro-) molecules

Clip2: Electro -ve

Clip3: Type of Bonds

ionic covalent     hydrogen (electrostatic) (very imp)     van-der-waals/non polar bond

Clip4: Recognizing Macro-molecules
4 Classes: Lipids Proteins Carbs Nucleic Acids

Lipids: 
	Make up cell membranes, parts of signal propagation system, Energy
	Non-Polar (Hydrophobic)
	Partly Polar (amphi-pathic lipid)
	long chain 

Carbs: 
	Energy/Cell Walls of Plants/ Essential Part of DNA
	CH2O : Basic Chemical Formula
	Monomer (Mononsaccharides (sugars))
	Polymers (Glycogen/Starch)

Nucleic Acids
	Make the Genes/Synthesis of other macro-molecules
	Made up of Nucleotides (Monomer)
		Phosphate
		Sugar (Ribose/Deoxyribose)
		Base (PSB) (AG CT)
	Polymer (DNA/RNA)
		AGCT (DNA)
		AGCU (RNA) (U is Uracil: Thymine without one methyl group)

Proteins
	Everything except hereditary info carrying
	Enzymes

	M = Amino Acid (20 Diff types essential for human life)
		Stru. : Alpha Carbon 
	Polymer = Protein


Recog: 
Lipid: Nonpolar/Hydrophobic
Carb: CH2O, Polar
Proteins: alpha carbon bonded to NH2 and COOH and R
Nucleic Acids: Nucleotide (P-> S-> B)![Screenshot 2024-10-16 at 14.02.02.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202024-10-16%20at%2014.02.02.png)


Clip5: Molecules of Acid: Nucleic Acid Polarity

Order and Polarity of Macromolecules = Info
	NAs (Hereditary Info)
	Protein (just about everything else

PS: keeps the nucleic acid together

Next Base adds to the 3Ã“H on the Sugar

Bases + Polarity are the important things ![Screenshot 2024-10-16 at 16.21.40.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202024-10-16%20at%2016.21.40.png)

Clip 6: Protein 
Read from N to C 

a ligand is some small molecule which interacts (usually non-covalently) with a protein





Q: What is docking?
