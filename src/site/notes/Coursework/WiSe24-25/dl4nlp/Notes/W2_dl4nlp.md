## Tokenization

A **morpheme** is the smallest unit of meaning in a language.

- **Free morphemes**: These can stand alone as words, such as "cat," "run," or "happy." Each one has meaning by itself.
    
- **Bound morphemes**: These cannot stand alone and need to attach to other morphemes. For example:
    
    - **Prefixes**: "un-" in "undo" or "re-" in "rewrite."
    - **Suffixes**: "-s" in "cats" (indicating plural) or "-ed" in "walked" (indicating past tense).
