Segment recurrence in the Transformer-XL model helps solve the problem of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, such as natural language.

In a standard Transformer model, the attention mechanism allows the model to capture dependencies between different parts of the input sequence. However, this attention is limited to the current input segment being processed. The model does not have a way to efficiently maintain and utilize information from previous segments.

This is where segment recurrence comes into play. By reusing the hidden states from the previous segment and concatenating them with the current segment's hidden states, the Transformer-XL model can maintain context and remember important information from the past. This allows the model to better capture long-range dependencies that span across multiple segments of the input sequence.

Without segment recurrence, the Transformer model would effectively "forget" the previous context when processing a new segment, leading to a loss of important information and potentially poorer performance on tasks that require understanding long-range relationships in the data.
