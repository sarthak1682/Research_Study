for some weird reason, he asks the reader to underline whenever someone goes "up" or "down", generally the meaning is normative

Glaucon: Justice = Adv. of the Weaker? 

nomos vs phases (artificial vs natural law)

good in itself, for what it gets one, *both* (hypothetical + categorical imperative)

city of utmost necessity: div of labour

the person/ppl ruling will be phil. dogs? 

being an "innovator" is an accusation, plato wants to eliminate it

attack on homer

socrates is the new achilles, haha

myth of metals

very rigid, hierarchical soc., not very open soc., kind of like a caste system (wtf, he sounds like lenin in practice)

quite censorious

very much an ascetic elite


wise, courageous, moderate : 3 parts of the soul (socrates, glaucon, adeimantus)

plato might have been a feminist

abolish "family" as an institution, kind of a eugenicist (private vs public good)
