Is Hume’s problem still a problem? #Phil

Relation to “Metaphysics+Epistemology” and “Ethics+Aesthetics” #Phil 

What does it (have to) assume as a given?  #Phil 
	Prescriptive Propositions have truth values? 
  
Ethics: values in, values out, metaethics necessary? #Phil 

Prescriptions have truth values? Which one opposed it? #Phil 

Turing test ofc #Phil #CompSci
[jagi-2019-0002](https://intapi.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jagi-2019-0002)
On Defining Artificial Intelligence by Pei Wang
	Do LLMs pass my Version? How? 

Strange Loop? #CogSci
	A data structure? D and P depending on D and P? 

How does it change AI research? You gotta have some values to steer it into a desired descriptive space, right? #CompSci 

How to send the gradient down from the KG to the Model? #CompSci 

Experiments DP #CompSci 
	Classifying Ds and Ps: Practically perfect! [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/c/66fd4cd9-e320-800b-a4e5-a16484febd6c)
Can a language model identify what a proposition even is? How does it determine it has a truth value? 

How are propositions represented in the NNs? #CompSci 

Birth of a Conjecture? 

Artificial Intelligence: Field of traversing the space of possible minds

On the role of Prescriptions in the Sciences #Phil


graph theory, describing the entire system from the inside? #Math #CompSci 
	“Trace” of a proposition. 

What does it mean to identify/resolve a disagreement? #Phil 
	Start from a common core, trace through another branch, could be a couple of nodes that are the deciding factor, at least figure out what it "hinges on"


What kind of description is an “explanation”  #Phil #CompSci 
	Reach of a node? 

Propositional Spaces? 

Self-Org and Society of Mind? #CompSci #CogSci 

Relation to Sellars’ Scientific vs Manifest Image #Phil 
	Manifest vs Scientific Image Space 
		ex. Newtonian Physics vs Intuitive Physics 
		(How do you come up with new stuff, a) by questioning the intuitions.. (/Inducing Crisis into the Intuitive Physics?)  b)?) 
			Perhaps that's the relation of CogSci and AI? #CompSci 
			[Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding | An Inquiry Into Human Knowl](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203781036/scripts-plans-goals-understanding-roger-schank-robert-abelson)
			"An Inquiry Into Human Knowledge Structures"
  

Relation to Pierce about “Prescriptions as constraints” at least a lower level.  #Phil 
	“These constraints can come from logic, experience, or **established knowledge**.”
		See how logic and established knowledge are related (through contradiction)

  Relation to Coherentism? #Phil 

Relation to the symbol grounding problem #CogSci 
[Site Unreachable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167278990900876)
 The symbol grounding problem by Stevan Harnad

Relation to the orthogonality thesis/ Alignment/MechInterpretability #Phil #CompSci 
[The Alignment Problem: How Can Machines Learn Human Values? - Brian Christian - Google Books](https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=TdL2DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT23&ots=0X44a1Hz9r&sig=fKsCtcQBK8H7JV4PPq4mLVhig1w&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)


Putting Morality on the Map? 

A proposition is a proposition is a proposition? 



Relation to computational irreducibility (and perhaps its relation with “abstraction levels”?) #Math 
	Relation to Mysterianism? #Phil 

Relation to Innatism #Phil 
	Can you bootstrap with data alone? #Math 

“Computable Descriptions” from the Core! #Math 
	ATP (Starting from the initial propositions AND upwards from the final theorems, where do the path meet in the middle.)

Goals of CogSci/AI #CogSci #CompSci 

What is a description anyway? #Phil #CompSci 

What is a prescription anyway? #Phil #CompSci 
	Constraints? 

A lot of terms can either be interpreted in these terms or just be straight up discarded. 
	What would alignment mean under this framework? Why is there no description space alignment but only prescriptions? Would aligning into some descriptive space ensure some particular prescriptive space #CompSci 
	What would “enlightenment” be in this framework? (Prescriptions getting us access to a descriptive space)  #Phil 
	What would Intelligence correspond to? (Speed of graph traversal?) #Math #Phil 
	Perhaps there are temperaments for different disciplines? Or is there a single one?  #psych 
	Let’s not speak of “Realism”… #Phil 


KG with node as output of a NN, NN inside NN
