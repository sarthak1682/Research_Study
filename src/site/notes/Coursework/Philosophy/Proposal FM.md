### What is to be done? 
The basic insight is the following:

"Descriptions and Prescriptions are the ONLY kind of propositions that exist" 
ex: "My iPad is black", "Gravity is the Curvature of Spacetime"
ex: "Thou shalt not kill", "Cheating is bad"

The emphasis is on "ONLY" and thus it makes up for a sufficient condition, reliably coming up with them would be sufficient for calling an entity "Intelligent". It seems like, and is, a well specified version of the turing test, albeit based on a true observation, and not on deceiving human observers!

If you want to further clarifications/ELI5 [[Coursework/Philosophy/A New Kind of Turing Test\|A New Kind of Turing Test]] , and for further questions in [[Coursework/Philosophy/DP\|DP]]  (marked with #CompSci might be relevant, that are listed below).

### How is it to be done? 
There I would need a lot of supervision it seems. My hunch is the following: 

On a very broad level: 
-  Generate Knowledge Graphs with LLMs and then use formal methods to reason over it/to check and provide feedback.
	- Think of entire propositions as Nodes. 
	- More basic "descriptions" and some "prescriptions" (can even be thought of as constrains on the search space) can be useful for coming up with new ones, that is, both new Descriptions and Prescriptions. 
	- Prescriptions might not seem very relevant for say Theorem Proving but it will certainly be interesting for Science/Ethics 
		- (e.g a simple difference of prescriptions can get you from a Physicist to a flat-earther! or It would preclude you from exploring a space of descriptions (e.g Info about Race, Gender etc.!))

One a very small scale: 
- Formalize the notion of a Descriptive Proposition (?) (Perhaps not needed if an LLM can be trained to classify)
- Formalize the notion of a Prescriptive Proposition(?)(Perhaps not needed if an LLM can be trained to classify)
- How to represent a Question in a KG?
- Reinterpret a lot of terms (e.g Explanation)

Potentially Important Tools/Concepts: 
	Knowledge Graphs 
	 Reasoning over KGs (Query2Box)
		 GNNs
		 Logic (of course)
	Belief Networks (?)/ Causal Networks (?)
	Argument Mining (?)
