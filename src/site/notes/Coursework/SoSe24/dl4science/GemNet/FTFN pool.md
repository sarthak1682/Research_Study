What is it? 
all rotationally equivariant linear functions on the SO(3) group, i.e. all SO(3) convolutions.

**Rotationally Equivariant Linear Functions**: These functions map inputs to outputs in a linear way that respects the rotational symmetries ofÂ SO(3).

example where rotational symmetry is not respected 2 0 0, 010, 001 = A
