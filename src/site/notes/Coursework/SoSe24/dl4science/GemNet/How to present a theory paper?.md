- **Not get lost in mathematical detail.** Instead of trying to understand (and present) every formula, it is more important to figure out why they are doing the derivations and how each step brings them closer to their final goal.
- **Summarize their most important points/steps in words** After reading the paper a first time, I would try to extract the most relevant steps that are essential for their approach. Since these will probably be formulated in equations, I'd try to formulate in words what the equation does and maybe even visualize it (What are the inputs, what does the output quantity mean?)
- **Only look at the proofs if they are REALLY relevant (or if you are interested in the math details.** Yes, this paper includes proofs which support their general argument, but they are not as important as understanding the problem and their method. Therefore, I would only look at the proofs if you think that they might help you with understanding the problem better, if they are really relevant to the paper (apparently they are not, because then they would be in the main paper), or if you enjoy diving into the maths. Please do not include the proofs in the presentation!

When you are preparing the presentation, I would ask myself the following questions:
- What is the minimal amount of maths required to understand the presented method? (Can you even go without maths?)
- What are their most important statements? How can I explain them as clearly as possible?
- If you want to include equations, I would try to simplify the notation (maybe some indices are not required to explain why this step leads to permutation equivariance?). Sometimes, one can visualize operations, e.g. applying a neural net to some input and transforming the output.
