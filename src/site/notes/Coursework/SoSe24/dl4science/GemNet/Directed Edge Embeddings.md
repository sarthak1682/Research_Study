Q - What are Embeddings? 
embeddings are a type of function or mapping that converts objects, like words or images, into vectors in a mathematical space, preserving semantic relationships. Ex. The vector for Vancouver is {49°15'40"N, 123°06'50"W, 662,248*}.

Q - Directed Edge Embeddings? 
vector representations assigned to edges in a directed graph

Q - Examples? 
In a social network graph, a directed edge embedding could represent the relationship between two users, where the direction indicates the direction of friendship (e.g., "user A follows user B"). The embedding would encode features like the strength of the connection, frequency of interaction, or similarity of interests between the users.
