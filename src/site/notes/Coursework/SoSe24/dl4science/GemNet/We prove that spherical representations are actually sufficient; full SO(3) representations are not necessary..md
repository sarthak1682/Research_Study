GNNs for molecules typically incorporate directional information in one of two ways- Via SO(3) representations  or by using directions in real space. Directions in real space are associated with the three-dimensional S2 sphere, while the SO(3) group is double covered by the fourdimensional S3 sphere
		Directional representations thus use one degree of freedom less than SO(3) representations, making them significantly cheaper. 
			How much? 
		directional representations actually provide the same expressivity as SO(3) representations for predictions in R3 (proof)
			[[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/preliminaries\|preliminaries]]
			We achieve this by showing that the SO(3)-based [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/tensor field network (TFN)\|tensor field network (TFN)]] variant used by Dym & Maron  is equivalent to a [[similar model based on spherical representations, in the case of rotationally invariant predictions\|similar model based on spherical representations, in the case of rotationally invariant predictions]].
