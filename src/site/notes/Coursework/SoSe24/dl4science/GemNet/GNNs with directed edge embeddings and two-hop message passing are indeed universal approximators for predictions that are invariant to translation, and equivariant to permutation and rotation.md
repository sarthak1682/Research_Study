To prove universality in the rotationally invariant case we extend a recent universality result based on point cloud models that use representations of the rotation group SO(3).

Universality: meaning the model can effectively learn any geometric configuration of atoms.

**Symmetric Message Passing**: Aggregates information from neighboring nodes in a way that is invariant to the order of these nodes
