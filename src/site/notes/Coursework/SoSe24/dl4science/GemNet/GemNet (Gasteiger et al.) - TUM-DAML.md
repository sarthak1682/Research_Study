# List of Assertions Made about GemNet (1)


1. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/GNNs with directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and equivariant to permutation and rotation\|GNNs with directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and equivariant to permutation and rotation]] : Proof and further assertions go here
2. [[We then leverage these insights and multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet)\|We then leverage these insights and multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet)]]: Do they actually "leverage" these? How? Perhaps ablations studies make it clear? 
3. [[Ablation Studies- GemNet\|Ablation Studies- GemNet]] 
4. [[GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL, MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34 %, 41 %, and 20 %, respectively, and\|GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL, MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34 %, 41 %, and 20 %, respectively, and]] Well this was clear from the paper anyway
5. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/performs especially well on the most challenging molecules.\|performs especially well on the most challenging molecules.]] What is the nature of these molecules? 


# Concepts/Assertions yet unknown (2)
1.  [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/Regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs\|Regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs]] (Find out which ones)
2. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/Directed Edge Embeddings\|Directed Edge Embeddings]]: Including "embeddings"
3. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/Regular GNNs are only as powerful as the 1-WL Test of Isomorphism\|Regular GNNs are only as powerful as the 1-WL Test of Isomorphism]] (Proof?)
4. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/Regular GNNs thus cannot distinguish between certain molecules\|Regular GNNs thus cannot distinguish between certain molecules]] (find out which ones)
5. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/Invariance and Equivariance\|Invariance and Equivariance]]: how to prove either
6. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/SO(3)\|SO(3)]]
7. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/Simply using the full geometric information (e.g. all pairwise atomic distances) in a layer does not ensure universal approximation.\|Simply using the full geometric information (e.g. all pairwise atomic distances) in a layer does not ensure universal approximation.]] : OK, how? 
8. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/Point Cloud Models\|Point Cloud Models]]

# Misc
"Instead, we need a model that preserves relative rotational information and is only invariant to global rotations": Is a motivation for the proof
