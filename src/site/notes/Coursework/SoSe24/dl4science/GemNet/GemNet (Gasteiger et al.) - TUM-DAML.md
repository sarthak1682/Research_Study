Practical 
1. [[We then leverage these insights and multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet)\|We then leverage these insights and multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet)]]: Do they actually "leverage" these? How? Perhaps ablations studies make it clear?

3. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL, MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34 %, 41 %, and 20 %, respectively, and\|GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL, MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34 %, 41 %, and 20 %, respectively, and]] Well this was clear from the paper anyway
4. [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/GemNet/performs especially well on the most challenging molecules.\|performs especially well on the most challenging molecules.]] What is the nature of these molecules?

## Misc
"Instead, we need a model that preserves relative rotational information and is only invariant to global rotations": Is a motivation for the proof
