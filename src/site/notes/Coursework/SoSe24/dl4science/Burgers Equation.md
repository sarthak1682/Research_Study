- u(x,t) is the fluid velocity
- x is the spatial coordinate
- t is time
- ν is the viscosity coefficient

The left-hand side contains the non-linear **advection term** ∂(u^2/2)/∂x which makes the equation non-linear.

The right-hand side is the **diffusion term** ν ∂^2u/∂x^2 which accounts for viscous effects.

The equation must be solved subject to some initial condition u(x,0) = u0(x).

Despite its simple form, the Burgers' equation exhibits very interesting phenomena like [[Coursework/SoSe24/dl4science/shock wave formation\|shock wave formation]] when the viscosity ν is small.
