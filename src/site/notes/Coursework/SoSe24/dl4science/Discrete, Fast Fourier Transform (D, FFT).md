3b1b - it's easy visualisation tbh. get the winding frequency and the COM moves when winding freq = freq. 

Reducible- great explanation on change of repr., very short algo. If ever in doubt, watch this one again.

DFT: O(N^2)

FFT uses the fact that w_N^2 = w_N/2

FFT: O(Nlog(N))

Use: Polynomials in Coeff into supporting point pres. 

find supporting points: x^3 + x
