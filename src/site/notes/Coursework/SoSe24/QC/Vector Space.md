A vector space is a mathematical structure formed by a collection of vectors, which can be added together and multiplied (scaled) by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are typically real or complex numbers. A vector space must satisfy the following properties (axioms):



1.	Closure under Addition:
$$
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V
$$
2.	Closure under Scalar Multiplication: 
$$
c\mathbf{v} \in V
$$
3.	Associativity of Addition: 
$$
\mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w}
$$
4.	Commutativity of Addition:
$$
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}
$$
5.	Identity Element of Addition: 
$$
\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v}
$$
6.	Inverse Elements of Addition: 
$$
\mathbf{v} + (-\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0}
$$
7.	Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication over Vector Addition: 
$$
c(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = c\mathbf{u} + c\mathbf{v}
$$
8.	Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication over Scalar Addition: 
$$
(a + b)\mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{v} + b\mathbf{v}
$$
9.	Associativity of Scalar Multiplication: 
$$
a(b\mathbf{v}) = (ab)\mathbf{v}
$$
10.	Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication: 
$$
1\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}
$$
