Square Integrable

A function  $f(x)$ is said to be square integrable if the integral of the square of its absolute value over the entire domain is finite. Mathematically, a function  $f(x)$  is square integrable if:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(x)|^2 \, dx < \infty $$


In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction of a particle is often a square-integrable function. This ensures that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space is finite and normalized to one.
