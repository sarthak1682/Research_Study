### **Characteristics**

- **Totality**: Primitive recursive functions are always defined for all inputs and always terminate.
- **Subset of Recursive Functions**: All primitive recursive functions are recursive, but not all recursive functions are primitive recursive (e.g., the Ackermann function is recursive but not primitive recursive because it grows too quickly to be defined using only primitive recursion).

Importance?
The class of primitive recursive functions captures many intuitively "computable" functions and forms the foundation for more complex theories of computability. It provides a structured, inductive definition of a class of functions that are guaranteed to be total.


But they are not the full story.
