Examples would be nice, Lecun?

>  (a) can sample randomly and unbiasedly, if they so wish; (b) has data which are noiseless, without error, and uncontaminated; (c) is free to use any means or methods for producing the AI (this can include present and future machine learning approaches, but is not limited to them); (d) is only required to produce with a probability slightly higher than chance an AI that matches human behaviour slightly better than chance; (e) is guaranteed that there exists an algorithm that meets those low-bar requirements


Yes, but the further question to ask is, under what constraints it becomes tractable.

> See Box 2 for a definition of makeism; in other words, all makeists think that building cognition is suf- ficient for being able to explain it (b), and some think that this building is also necessary (c). The necessity claim especially reveals the implicit assumption that it is possible to build cognition (a).

Interesting...

Yeah, but where the hell is "human-likeness"? 
	There are no constraints for it being "human-like"? These are just random s-b pairings, no surprise it's fucking intractable ffs.

Ask him about the AI Scientist, who are building it.
