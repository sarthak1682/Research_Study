hmmm...? Really?

perceptual vs intellectual? UNDERHANDED!

> Definition 1. A model is elementwise representational (ER) if all model elements (variables, relations, and parameters) represent an element in the phenomenon (components, dependencies, properties).

Interesting!

> . A typical non-representational element used in scientific models is a noise term. Instead of representing a specific component or a property of the phenomenon, the noise can be a placeholder for unexplained aspects of the phenomenon (Edmonds 2006)

very interesting!
