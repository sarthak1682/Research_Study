> “this central point was decisively furthered, in my case, by the reading of David Hume’s and Ernst Mach’s philosophical writings” (quoted in Norton 2010). While rationalist philosophers like Immanuel Kant thought that absolute simultaneity was necessarily entailed by our a priori conception of spacetime, Einstein reasoned that if even these bedrock concepts were learned from experience, then there might be exceptions to them in extreme conditions, such as when objects travel at velocities approaching the speed of light

ok, now, this is important info!

find which! : No idea

> Rationalists tend to be “internalists”—that is, they think that mental processes are correct if they follow a set of rules, such as logic or decision theory. Empiricists, on the other hand, tend to be “externalists,” evaluating mental processes in terms of their reliability or success in particular environments.

lol, ok, that's the notion?
