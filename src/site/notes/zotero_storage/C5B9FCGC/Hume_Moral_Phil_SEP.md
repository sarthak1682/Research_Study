> although reason is needed to discover the facts of any concrete situation and the general social impact of a trait of character or a practice over time, reason alone is insufficient to yield a judgment that something is virtuous or vicious.

Here is the relevant passage

>  natural or conventional.

Well, false dichotomy much?

>  Thus he takes an intermediate position: some virtues are natural, and some are the products of convention.

Hume seems smart, just freakin decide it case by case, esp when the abstraction layers are so radically different.

> Linked with these meta-ethical controversies is the dilemma of understanding the ethical life either as the “ancients” do, in terms of virtues and vices of character, or as the “moderns” do, primarily in terms of principles of duty or natural law.

That's interesting, seems to be me, cognitive config vs duty to others (inside vs outside)

> According to Hume’s theory of the mind, the passions (what we today would call emotions, feelings, and desires) are impressions rather than ideas (original, vivid and lively perceptions that are not copied from other perceptions).

Impressions vs Ideas?

> It is only when, and because, the action’s cause is some enduring passion or trait of character in the agent that she is to blame for it

Well, that's quite thoughtful, if someone is likely to do it repeatedly because of what they are!

> The second argument is a corollary of the first. It takes as a premise the conclusion just reached, that reason alone cannot produce an impulse to act. Given that, can reason prevent action or resist passion in controlling the will? To stop a volition or retard the impulse of an existing passion would require a contrary impulse. If reason alone could give rise to such a contrary impulse, it would have an original influence on the will (a capacity to cause intentional action, when unopposed); which, according to the previous argument, it lacks. Therefore reason alone cannot resist any impulse to act. Therefore, what offers resistance to our passions cannot be reason of itself. Hume later proposes that when we restrain imprudent or immoral impulses, the contrary impulse comes also from passion, but often from a passion so “calm” that we confuse it with reason.

Lol, no. Read it again, but seems deeply mistaken, also pursue the last line.

There seems to be a lot of interesting mistakes in the third Argument

> . Such a reading should be met with caution, however. For Hume, to say that something is not a product of reason alone is not equivalent to saying it is not a truth-evaluable judgment or belief.

So, he ain't a vulgar emotivist, it seems.
