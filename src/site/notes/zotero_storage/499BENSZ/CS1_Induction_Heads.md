#### Function and Mechanism

Induction heads operate using a 'prefix matching' attention pattern. This pattern allows them to scan previous tokens and identify if any of them match the current token. Instead of merely relying on pre-learned statistical tendencies of token sequences, induction heads dynamically focus on prior tokens that bear similarity to the current one, leveraging learned representations. **When a token is sufficiently similar to a prior token, the induction head attends to the subsequent token in the sequence. Consequently, it increases the probability of predicting that the current sequence will continue similarly to the matched prior sequence.**

**Example:**Â If the input contains the sequence "...the cat sat on the mat. The cat...", the induction head identifies the second "cat" token as matching the first one. It then attends to the token "sat" from the first sequence, increasing the likelihood of "sat" being predicted again. This capability enables Transformer models to replicate sequences and generalize patterns.

This mechanism is akin to **indirect addressing in classical systems, where variable binding is enabled.** An attention head stores information about a token preceding another token in a dedicated subspace of the residual stream (previous_token subspace). A different attention head in a subsequent layer can retrieve this information for further processing. This separation of storage and use is fundamental to computation involving bound variables, as highlighted by Smolensky (1988) and Gallistel & King (2011).

#### Importance for In-Context Learning

Circuits utilizing induction heads are potentially crucial for the advanced in-context learning abilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs). Even in simplified scenarios, such as when the context includes "...the cat sat on the mat. **The dog...", an induction head can generalize that "dog" indicates the continuation of the sequence, even if "dog" and "sat" have never appeared together in training.** Research by Mirchandani et al. (2023) underscores that Transformer models excel at identifying complex abstract patterns in context and extrapolating from them.
