**1. Mapping Numbers to Rotations:**

- **Embedding:** Input numbers are mapped onto points on a unit circle. This visualization helps us understand that numbers are represented as angles or rotations.
- **Rotation Composition:** When two numbers are added, their corresponding rotations are composed. This composition is achieved by adding the angles of the rotations.

**2. Modular Addition:**

- **Trigonometric Identities:** The network leverages trigonometric identities to perform this rotation composition. This is where the "Fourier multiplication" analogy comes into play.
- **Prime Modulus:** The addition is performed modulo a prime number. This means that the result is the remainder when the sum is divided by the prime number.

**3. Learning Phases:**

- **Memorization:** Initially, the network memorizes the training data without fully understanding the underlying pattern.
- **Circuit Formation:** The network starts to form the "Fourier multiplication" circuit, gradually learning the trigonometric relationships involved.
- **Cleanup:** The network refines the circuit, removing unnecessary components and improving its generalization ability. This phase is often referred to as "grokking."
